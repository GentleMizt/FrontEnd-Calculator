## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

More Flexibility with Javascript Arrays and Array Methods, got more insight on the beauty of the Switch Statement Javascript
and learned a new method the javascript eval() method



### Continued development

Moving forward, i'd be taking on more projects to get familiar with the JavaScript language, knowing how to deduce the logic of a project, e.t.c.

### Useful resources

- [Resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS6Y0ezhyCs&feature=youtu.be) - This helped me for with the array methods and the eval function used in this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
